## About Data Science Algorithms 🧠

### Machine Learning Algorithms 🤖

Machine learning algorithms are computational models that learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Common machine learning algorithms include:
- Linear Regression 📈
- Decision Trees 🌳
- Random Forests 🌲
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) 🛠️
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- Naive Bayes 📝
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) ⚡

### Deep Learning Models 🧠

Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are capable of learning complex patterns from large volumes of data. Some popular deep learning models include:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🖼️
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 🔄
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) 🧠
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 🎨
- Transformers 🤖
